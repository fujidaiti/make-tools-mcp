# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Principles

Here are most prioritized rules you should follow:

- Don't hesitate to remove stale or temporary files or lines of code as we are using Git; Leaving change-log comments like `UPDATED: 2025-10-02` and `~AddNewTask button~ EDIT: this feature has been removed` is also discouraged.
- Name temporary files with a suffix of `.tmp.*` like `*.tmp.dart` and `*.tmp.md`.
